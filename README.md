# Datafest2019
Team MCMC Hammer's top prize data project for Duke's datafest 2019 (won top prize in visualization)

I have included the original presentation and writeup from the competition in April 2019, along with the materials used to present the findings at the Durham chapter of the RLadies meetup in October 2019.
